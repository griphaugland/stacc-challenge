This is my submission for the Stacc challenge

## heads-up
On this project I have focused on making this function for mobile devices with a min-with of 320px to a max-width of 550px. 
The reasoning for this is that the application is created to be used in a banking app.

## explanation
The idea behind the app is to give users a good way to save money when having the urge to buy something. Buying on impulse is something that most people do once in a while. With Impulsknappen added as a widget or just using it in the app, users can feel good about themselves by clicking the button every time there is an urge to buy something. 
People like to feel good about their choices. By giving them the ability to send the money they were to spend on an impulse buy, to a locked bank account in a single click, they will learn to save and value the money they have. 

## how-does-it-work
The value in each click can be decided by the user and is standard 5NOK and maximum 5000NOK. 
One click starts the function. After the button registers 2 minutes of inactivity, a function will multiply the amount of clicks by the input value and give a total sum. 
This sum will be charged directly to the users bank-account and the money will be sent to a separate account with the name of the users saving goal (sparem√•l).
The user also gets to decide if they want to lock the account for a certain amount of time, or if they wish to leave the account open.
The standard here will be to lock the saving goal account for 2 months. A pop-up will however ask the user for this information the first time it is used.
